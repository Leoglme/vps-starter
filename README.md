# VPS Starter

This repository contains scripts to simplify the configuration and deployment of websites on a VPS server. It is particularly useful for system administrators and developers who want to automate the setting up of websites with Nginx and secure them with SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

## Structure

This repository is organized into separate folders for different web technologies:
- `preparte_environment`: Scripts and configurations for preparing the VPS to host websites.
- `setup_site`: Scripts and configurations for setting up websites with Nginx and Let's Encrypt.
- `nuxtjs3`: Scripts and configurations for deploying Nuxt.js 3 applications.
- `vuejs3`: Scripts and configurations for deploying Vue.js 3 applications.
- `adonisjs`: Scripts and configurations for deploying AdonisJS applications.

Each folder contains a `deploy-vps.yml` file for GitHub Actions and an `nginx.conf` file for Nginx configuration specific to the technology.

## Features
- `prepare_environment.sh`: A script to install Nginx and Certbot, thereby preparing the VPS to host websites.
- `setup_site.sh`: A script to quickly configure a new website with Nginx and obtain an SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux VPS (preferably Debian or Ubuntu)
- A domain name (e.g. `example.com`) with an A record pointing to the IP address of the VPS
- A user account with `sudo` privileges

## Usage

### Preparing the Environment
1. Clone this repository to your VPS or directly download the scripts.
2. Make the `prepare_environment.sh` script executable by running `chmod +x prepare_environment.sh`
3. Run the script with `sudo sh ./prepare_environment.sh`

### Setting up a Website
1. Clone this repository to your VPS or directly download the scripts.
2. Make the `setup_site.sh` script executable by running `chmod +x setup_site.sh`
3. Run the script with `sudo sh ./setup_site.sh example.com` 
<br>
Replace `example.com` with your domain or subdomain name.


## Specific Deployment Instructions

### Nuxt.js 3 Deployment

- #### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Navigate to the [nuxtjs3](nuxtjs3) directory.
2. Use the [deploy-vps.yml](nuxtjs3/deploy-vps.yml) in your GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process.
3. Add `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USERNAME`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `SSH_PORT` as secrets to your GitHub repository.
4. Replace `/var/www/dibodev.com/html` with the path to your application on your VPS.
5. Replace `dibodev.com` with your pm2 process name.

- #### Nginx Configuration
1. Customize the [nginx.conf](nuxtjs3/nginx.conf) file as needed and place it in your Nginx configuration directory (usually `/etc/nginx/sites-available`) on your VPS.


### Vue.js 3 Deployment

- Navigate to the `vuejs3` directory.

### AdonisJS Deployment

- #### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Navigate to the [adonisjs](adonisjs) directory.
2. Use the [deploy-vps.yml](adonisjs/deploy-vps.yml) in your GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process.
3. Add `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USERNAME`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `SSH_PORT` as secrets to your GitHub repository.
4. To generate .env file, add `APP_KEY`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` as secrets to your GitHub repository.
5. Replace `/var/www/dibodev.com/html` with the path to your application on your VPS.
6. Replace `dibodev.com` with your pm2 process name.

- #### Nginx Configuration
1. Customize the [nginx.conf](adonisjs/nginx.conf) file as needed and place it in your Nginx configuration directory (usually `/etc/nginx/sites-available`) on your VPS.

## Automated Database Backup
### Backup MariaDB Database to FTP

The [mariadb/backup-ftp-database.yml](mariadb/backup-ftp-database.yml) workflow automates the process of backing up your MariaDB database to an FTP server. 
This is crucial for ensuring data safety and quick recovery in case of data loss.

#### Workflow Details
  The workflow is scheduled to run every 12 hours (at 00:00 and 12:00 each day). It can also be triggered manually via GitHub Actions.

#### Steps Performed
1. Install MariaDB Client and Gzip: Prepares the environment by installing necessary tools.
2. MySQLDump - Database Backup: Connects to your MariaDB database and creates a compressed backup file.
3. Set Current Date and Time: Generates a timestamp to label the backup file.
4. Deploy Backup to FTP: Uploads the backup file to the specified FTP server.

#### Configuration
To use this workflow, you need to set the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `DATABASE_HOST`: The hostname of your MariaDB server.
- `DATABASE_USERNAME`: The username for the database.
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: The password for the database.
- `DATABASE_DB_NAME`: The name of the database to back up.
- `SERVER_FTP_HOST`: The FTP server hostname.
- `SERVER_FTP_USERNAME`: The FTP server username.
- `SERVER_FTP_PASSWORD`: The FTP server password.
- `SERVER_FTP_PORT`: The FTP server port (optional).

## Resolve problems
- resolve the right problem on job ðŸ“¤ Deploy to VPS
  - check whether the user `SSH_USERNAME` has the necessary rights to the path `/var/www/[domain]/html`: 
  ```shell
    ls -ld /var/www/[domain]/html
  ```
    - if not, change the owner of the path `/var/www/[domain]/html` to the user `SSH_USERNAME`:
    ```shell
        sudo chown -R [SSH_USERNAME]:[SSH_USERNAME] /var/www/[domain]/html
    ```
