## Structure

This repository is organized into separate folders for different web technologies:
- [prepare_environment.sh](prepare_environment.sh): Scripts and configurations for preparing the VPS to host websites.
- [setup_site.sh](setup_site.sh): Scripts and configurations for setting up websites with Nginx and Let's Encrypt.
- [nuxtjs3](nuxtjs3): Scripts and configurations for deploying Nuxt.js 3 applications.
- [vuejs3](vuejs3): Scripts and configurations for deploying Vue.js 3 applications.
- [adonisjs](adonisjs): Scripts and configurations for deploying AdonisJS applications.

Each folder contains a `deploy-vps.yml` file for GitHub Actions and an `nginx.conf` file for Nginx configuration specific to the technology.

## Features
- [prepare_environment.sh](prepare_environment.sh): A script to install Nginx and Certbot, thereby preparing the VPS to host websites.
- [setup_site.sh](setup_site.sh): A script to quickly configure a new website with Nginx and obtain an SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux VPS (preferably Debian or Ubuntu)
- A domain name (e.g. `example.com`) with an A record pointing to the IP address of the VPS
- A user account with `sudo` privileges

## Usage

### Preparing the Environment
1. Clone this repository to your VPS or directly download the scripts.
2. Make the `prepare_environment.sh` script executable by running `chmod +x prepare_environment.sh`
3. Run the script with `sudo sh ./prepare_environment.sh`

### Setting up a Website
1. Clone this repository to your VPS or directly download the scripts.
2. Make the `setup_site.sh` script executable by running `chmod +x setup_site.sh`
3. Run the script with `sudo sh ./setup_site.sh example.com` 
<br>
Replace `example.com` with your domain or subdomain name.


## Specific Deployment Instructions

### Nuxt.js 3 Deployment

- #### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Navigate to the [nuxtjs3](nuxtjs3) directory.
2. Use the [deploy-vps.yml](nuxtjs3/deploy-vps.yml) in your GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process.
3. Add `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USERNAME`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `SSH_PORT` as secrets to your GitHub repository.
4. Replace `/var/www/dibodev.com/html` with the path to your application on your VPS.
5. Replace `dibodev.com` with your pm2 process name.

- #### Nginx Configuration
1. Customize the [nginx.conf](nuxtjs3/nginx.conf) file as needed and place it in your Nginx configuration directory (usually `/etc/nginx/sites-available`) on your VPS.

### Notes on Nuxt.js 3 Deployment
- The GitHub Actions workflow for Nuxt.js 3 automates the process of pulling the latest code from the repository, installing dependencies, building the application, and deploying it to the specified VPS using SSH.
- The provided `nginx.conf` is optimized for Nuxt.js 3 applications and includes HTTPS configuration with HTTP/2 support.

## Vue.js 3 Deployment

- #### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Navigate to the [vuejs3](vuejs3) directory.
2. Use the [deploy-vps.yml](vuejs3/deploy-vps.yml) in your GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment of Vue.js 3 applications.
3. Add `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USERNAME`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `SSH_PORT` as secrets to your GitHub repository.
4. Replace `/var/www/dibodev.com/html` with the path to your application on your VPS.
5. After the deployment, verify the application is running correctly by accessing your domain in a web browser.

- #### Nginx Configuration
1. Customize the [nginx.conf](vuejs3/nginx.conf) file as per your requirements. This configuration sets up an HTTPS server for Vue.js 3 applications.
2. Place the `nginx.conf` file in the Nginx configuration directory (usually `/etc/nginx/sites-available`) on your VPS.
3. Ensure that the SSL certificates specified in the configuration are correctly installed and valid for your domain.
4. Test the Nginx configuration by running `sudo nginx -t` and then reload Nginx with `sudo systemctl reload nginx`.

### Notes on Vue.js 3 Deployment
- The GitHub Actions workflow for Vue.js 3 automates the process of pulling the latest code from the repository, installing dependencies, building the application, and deploying it to the specified VPS using SSH.
- The provided `nginx.conf` is optimized for Vue.js 3 applications and includes HTTPS configuration with HTTP/2 support.

### AdonisJS Deployment

- #### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Navigate to the [adonisjs](adonisjs) directory.
2. Use the updated [deploy-vps.yml](adonisjs/deploy-vps.yml) in your GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process of AdonisJS applications.
3. Add necessary secrets such as `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USERNAME`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SSH_PORT`, `APP_KEY`, `DATABASE_DB_NAME`, `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` to your GitHub repository.
4. Modify the `APP_DIR` and `DOMAIN` environment variables in the workflow to match your deployment directory and pm2 process name.
5. The workflow now includes steps to set up the production `.env` file using `.env.production` and update it with secrets.

- #### Nginx Configuration
1. Ensure that the [nginx.conf](adonisjs/nginx.conf) file is customized for your AdonisJS application and placed in the Nginx configuration directory (usually `/etc/nginx/sites-available`) on your VPS.
2. After deployment, confirm that Nginx has restarted successfully and the application is running as expected.

### Notes on AdonisJS Deployment
- The updated deployment process simplifies the creation and updating of the `.env` file for production use.
- Additional commands have been added to restart the API using PM2, run database migrations, and seed the database after deployment.
- The deployment script now also ensures that Nginx is restarted, ensuring that any configuration changes are applied.

## Automated Database Backup
### Backup MariaDB Database to FTP

The [mariadb/backup-ftp-database.yml](mariadb/backup-ftp-database.yml) workflow automates the process of backing up your MariaDB database to an FTP server. 
This is crucial for ensuring data safety and quick recovery in case of data loss.

#### Workflow Details
  The workflow is scheduled to run every 12 hours (at 00:00 and 12:00 each day). It can also be triggered manually via GitHub Actions.

#### Steps Performed
1. Install MariaDB Client and Gzip: Prepares the environment by installing necessary tools.
2. MySQLDump - Database Backup: Connects to your MariaDB database and creates a compressed backup file.
3. Set Current Date and Time: Generates a timestamp to label the backup file.
4. Deploy Backup to FTP: Uploads the backup file to the specified FTP server.

#### Configuration
To use this workflow, you need to set the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `DATABASE_HOST`: The hostname of your MariaDB server.
- `DATABASE_USERNAME`: The username for the database.
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: The password for the database.
- `DATABASE_DB_NAME`: The name of the database to back up.
- `SERVER_FTP_HOST`: The FTP server hostname.
- `SERVER_FTP_USERNAME`: The FTP server username.
- `SERVER_FTP_PASSWORD`: The FTP server password.
- `SERVER_FTP_PORT`: The FTP server port (optional).

## Resolve problems
- resolve the right problem on job ðŸ“¤ Deploy to VPS
  - check whether the user `SSH_USERNAME` has the necessary rights to the path `/var/www/[domain]/html`: 
  ```shell
    ls -ld /var/www/[domain]/html
  ```
    - if not, change the owner of the path `/var/www/[domain]/html` to the user `SSH_USERNAME`:
    ```shell
        sudo chown -R [SSH_USERNAME]:[SSH_USERNAME] /var/www/[domain]/html
    ```
